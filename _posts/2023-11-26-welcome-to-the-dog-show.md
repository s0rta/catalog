One of the first things my friend Tyler and I ever talked about was procedurally generated sports bettings sims, mainly Blaseball (RIP)
and this project he made for a powerpoint party where he had built this giant spreadsheet,
gave a bunch of fake dogs silly names and stats, and ran said dogs though a myriad of simulations to find out who would win a data driven dog show.
This conversation was a few years ago but the dog show sim never really left my mind as an idea to explore,
specifically now that there is a Blaseball sized hole in the internet.
The scheme is, move from a spreadsheet to a website, automate the sims,
and build a grandiose lore of triumphs and close misses, on a tight schedule of a season a week, allowing storying lines to be born out of fan speculation,
creating an improvisational (albeit massaged) arc though the world of cosmic-not-quite-horror (cosmic-weird?) dog(ish) show(down).

Put another way, let's take the best part about sports (the charts, the stats, and the multi season arcs),
throw it though one of those wibbly wobbly snapchat filters,and paint on a cute dog…
That last bit raises another question that needs an answer, where are all those cute dogs gonna come from? Clip art? Stock images?
The idea right now is to lean into the weirdness of low parameter image models and AI generate the pics, allowing us to put big quotes around the word “dog”.
This also lets us invent new dog breeds, slowly breaking down the barrier between puppy and eldritch being one season at a time.
The project has been a slow burn, mainly a joke between friends, but the goal is that it sees the light of day sooner or later.

There are still questions to answer, specifically I feel like there's a weird ethical quandary around dog shows that doesn’t exist in something like baseball,
so making sure the game doesn’t have a pro dog show twist is a must,
I think one thing for sure is that these dogs are all immortal beings,
and there are no breeders, the dogs just show up looking to competed, as is their right in this strange simulation of ours.
